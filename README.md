This repository contains the analytical scripts and supporting data for a submitted manuscript.

📖 Overview
This collection of scripts processes, analyzes, and visualizes data from CMIP6 model simulations to reproduce the key findings of our study. 
The workflow includes data preprocessing, statistical computation, and figure generation.

📊 Input Data
The analysis is based on climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). 
These datasets are publicly available and can be downloaded from official portals like the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF).

🛠️ Dependencies
To run these scripts, you need the following softwares and toolboxes:
1. MATLAB (tested on R2020a or later)
   Required Toolboxes: M_map, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.
2. CDO (Climate Data Operators) (version 1.9.8 or later)
